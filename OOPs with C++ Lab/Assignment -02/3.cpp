/*
Q3.Write a program based on the above criteria to input name, address, amount of purchase and the type of purchase
 (L for Laptop and D for Desktop) by a customer. Compute and print the net amount to be paid by a customer along with his name
  and address.
(Hint: Discount = (discount rate / 100) * amount of purchase, Net amount = amount of purchase â€“ discount)
